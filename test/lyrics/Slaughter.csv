Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,I see a silhouette by the window
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,There's a nightgown on the floor
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,I feel desire in your eyes
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,I taste the honey of your soul
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,Do you feel dizzy without a drink of wine
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,"Is this forever, or does this happen every time"
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,In the heat of the moment
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,When two bodies are melting as one
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,Embers fallin' down from the fire above
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,And you'll be cryin' out for more
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,In the heat of the moment
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,I slip her hair through my fingertips
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,And I kiss her head to toe
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,Waves are crashin' in my heart
Slaughter,Heat Of The Moment,But you will never know
Slaughter,Rocky Mountain Way,Travelin down life's empty highway
