Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,A stranger lying on a bar room floor
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Had drank so much he could drink no more
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,So he fell asleep with a troubled brain
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,To dream that he rode on that downbound train
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,The engine with blood was sweaty and damp
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,And imps for fuel were shovelling bones
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,While the furnace rang with a thousand groans
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,The boiler was filled with lager beer
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,The devil himself was the engineer
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,The passengers were most a motley crew
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Some were foreigners and others he knew
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,"Rich men in broadcloth, beggars in rags"
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,As the train rushed on at a terrible pace
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Wider and wider the country grew
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Faster and faster the engine flew
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Louder and louder the thunder crashed
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Hotter and hotter the air became
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Till their clothes were burned
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,And they were screaming with pain
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,Then out of the distance there came a yell

Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,He fell on his knees on the bar room floor
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,And prayed a prayer like never before
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,And the prayers and vows were not in vain
Chuck Berry,Downbound Train,For he never rode that downbound train

Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"It was in ancient history, four thousand B.C."
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Back up in the jungle in a coconut tree
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Hanging on a branch up under the sun
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Was a meddlesome monkey named Jo Jo Gunne
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Old Leo the lion came down from the mountain
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,To get a drink of water from the jungle fountain
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo the monkey started tellin' him jive
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,About the elephant who was gonna skin him alive
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Leo tried to reach and grab Jo Jo's tail

Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"And said, put up your dukes you gotta tussle with me"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,An ol' eagle from Asia made a non stop flight
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Tryin' to make it in time, just to see them fight"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,A crocodile phoned and reversed the charge
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Coming all the way from India on a local barge
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Ol' gorilla heard 'em talking in the lion's den
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,But Jo Jo bet him three bucks the elephant wins
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Jo Jo yelled at Leo, Go on, knock him down"

Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,The elephant took his snoot and grabbed a coconut
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Leo fired a beautiful short back cross
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,That's when the coconut landed up against his jaw
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Leo grew tired, but he wouldn't give in"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"The elephant all loose, beat his jawbone in"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"The buzzard said, they fought furious all day"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,He couldn't understand how Leo got away
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Jo Jo runnin' everywhere, spreadin' the news"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,To the zebras and the leopards and the kangaroos
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,A hoot owl reported everything he saw
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Had his eyes wide open, they called it a draw"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Leo limping back with his jawbone bruised
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo in the trees started singin' the blues
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Laughin', meddling, jumpin' up and down"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Till his foot missed a limb and he fell to the ground
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Just like a bolt of thunder and a streak of heat
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Leo covered Jo Jo with all four feet
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo was screamin' with tears in his eyes
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Said, please mister Leo, I apologize"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"Said, if you let my feet upon solid ground"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,"I'll fight you close range, fifteen rounds"
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Leo got back to the square of the fight
Chuck Berry,Jo Jo Gunne,Jo Jo took a leap and jumped... out of sight

Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"When I build my home,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That I shall have some day;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),It'll be like I want it
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Oh - and I mean that in every way.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I have yet to see any
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That would cope with the style -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Of the house that I dream of;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That I'll build after a while.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"The roof of it will have peak lines,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And contours that dip;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And form shadowy eaves,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Where the little raindrops can drip.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"...That sweet pitter patter,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Of raindrops at play -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Is such a beautiful sound
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),On a quiet gloomy day.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"You know, when the wind is high,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And the storm gods race,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And I'll be snugged up
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),By my fire-place.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"Maybe feeding my little dog,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Or playing with my little cat.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"But unconsciously yearning,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And wonderin' where you're at.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),But when the meadow is shadowed
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),By that old sinking sun;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And the roses are bowing
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),For the dew drops to come;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"At my old upright piano,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"With pure ivory keys,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I'll just plunk out some vibrations
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Of whatever I please.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"Sometimes it'll be classics,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Sometimes lullabies;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),But mostly rock n' roll
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),- that I'll surely improvise.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And with my favourite guitar,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I'll be just strummin' away
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And bidding goodbye,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),To another beautiful day.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"A portrait of my angel,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That I love most of all -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I'll have painted from a snapshot
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Onto my bedroom wall.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"Where the suns warm rays,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And the moon's cold beam
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"Will cast her reflection,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),As I lay there and dream.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"You know, I can't deny"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"- but it makes me so sad,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),When I think that I've lost
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),All that I could have had.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),It was best for her -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And I guess I, I know;"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That she measured my love -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And then asked me to go.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"Then Finally my house,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I will have it complete.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And I'll take up a smoke,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Sitting by the window sill.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And I'll read my many books
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That I'll have in my bachelors nest;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),While the sun goes drooping
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),- down in the west.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"And I'll feel that gold,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Warm light on my face;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And then I'll start trippin'
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),To some far off place.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"That through all of my travels,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),I must have missed somewhere -
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),A place that I might find
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),My angel someday.
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And I'll leave all that I have
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"To the gods, up above;"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),And go spend my life searching
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"For the angel, that I love."
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),"For all of my dreams,"
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Would be but a souvenir;
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),Compared to the one
Chuck Berry,My Dream (Poem),That I love so dear.

Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"When he was a child, just a baby boy"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,He wanted to play rock music and sing some songs of joy

Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Rock it, rock it, rock it along"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Roll it, roll it, roll it on"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Git it, git it, git it on"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Got it, got it, got it and gone"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Then one day it happened, they hauled him off to war"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Way over there in no man's land, just him and his guitar"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Nobody near to love him, nobody ever sent him news"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"What could a poor boy do at night, but to sit down and sing them blues"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"Early one morning they called him, oh, what a beautiful day"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,They packed him in an old army plane and flew him back home to stay
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,"He landed in Clark Air base, but didn't have no place to go"
Chuck Berry,Got It And Gone,So he sit down with his guitar in the middle of the street and gave everybody a free show
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,My buddy finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield into
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,It was a group in automation getting together two by two
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,So they began to come together as I will try to do with you
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd shun"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you"
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through
Chuck Berry,Talkin' About My Buddy,"Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue"

Chuck Berry,Dutchman,A bunch of guys was in this bar room
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Most of them had been there half the day
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,They'd been telling jokes and fairy tales lying
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Just to pass the time away
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Then suddenly someone cracked the bar room door
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And then pushed it open wide
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And this huge tall dark dude
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Bowed his head and stepped inside
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,I wonder where he's from?
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Some blonde asked
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,The wind must have blown him in
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,But an old Dutchman offered him a drink
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"What will it be, whisky, rum or gin?"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"Sick him Fido, a redhead shouted"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Show him his way back to the street
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,But the Great Dane just walked over and licked his hand
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And lay down at his feet
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"He said if you spare me that drink, Dutchman"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,I promise I'll tell you how
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,That I came to be the helpless sight
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,That stands before you now
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,I used to be an artist
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Not one who sits and fiddle out on the curb
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,But in my day and time
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,My music was considered superb
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,I wrote a song about a poor kid
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Raised down in New Orleans
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,It didn't make the hall of fame
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"But it bought us shrimp, rice and beans"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"He kept at it until it made the big time,"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Playing town after town
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Until he met a woman he fell in love with
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And it really turned his life around
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,She had eyes like Cleopatra
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And a head of luxurious hair
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,With the brilliance of her beauty
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,None other could compare
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,When she lifted her eyes to his
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Her lips would fall apart
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Each time she allowed him kiss her
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,It near petrified his heart
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,But when he ask her would she marry him
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,He'd give her everything he had
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,She turned and walked away
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And it nearly drove him mad
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,He promised her a half a million
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And would even pay in advance
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,If she would let him prove himself
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Or at least give him a chance
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And if he should go blind
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And had to use his hands to feel
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,He would hire someone to do her work
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,And prepare her every meal
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,How could a man love a woman so much?
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,Not one of you would think!
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"Well, I did and I still do"
Chuck Berry,Dutchman,"Hey Dutchman, you promised me a drink!"

Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,And know that they know
Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,"Are of wisdom, appreciate them"
Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,Oh but the temples created in woman
Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,Never have failed in statue and goal
Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,Deep in her heart she fills her temple
Chuck Berry,Eyes Of Man,In her own child's immortal soul
