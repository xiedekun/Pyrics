Warrant,Music Man,Momma pull me and said
Warrant,Music Man,"Hey son, you stay close to me. Yes Ma'am"
Warrant,Music Man,Now it's not polite to stare at the man over there
Warrant,Music Man,With his dusty old clothes and his long long black hair. No momma

Warrant,Music Man,Never had a dime or a plan
Warrant,Music Man,"Just an old soul axe slingin' blues singin' music man,"
Warrant,Music Man,"Yeah, that's right, music man"
Warrant,Music Man,Tellin' tall tales of ridin' the rails
Warrant,Music Man,Just broke as a joke with a beat up old guitar to play
Warrant,Music Man,See he'd sit outside of the old drug store
Warrant,Music Man,Playin' songs full of pain and beggin' for a little spare change
Warrant,Music Man,Everybody thought he was lazy or crazy
Warrant,Music Man,Never had a dime or a plan
Warrant,Music Man,"Just an old soul axe slingin' blues singin' music man,"
Warrant,Music Man,"Yeah yeah, music man"
Warrant,Music Man,Church folk said he made a deal with the devil
Warrant,Music Man,And his chickens had all come home
Warrant,Music Man,That's why he didn't have a pot to piss in
Warrant,Music Man,No woman no friends and he spent his life alone
Warrant,Music Man,"Oh, spent his life alone"
