Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green, a second scene"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,A fight between the blue you once knew.
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Floating down, the sound resounds"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,Around the icy waters underground.
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania."
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten."
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green, a second scene"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,A fight between the blue you once knew.
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Floating down, the sound resounds"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,Around the icy waters underground.
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania."
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Neptune, Titan, Stars can frighten."
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Blinding signs flap,"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Flicker, flicker, flicker blam. Pow, pow."
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Stairway scare, Dan Dare, who's there?"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green, the sounds around"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,The icy waters under
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,"Lime and limpid green, the sounds around"
Pink Floyd,Astronomy Domine,The icy waters underground.
