Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,But I still don't seem to care
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,But I still don't seem to care
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,"Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share"
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,But I still don't seem to care
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,I know what it means to be alone
Led Zeppelin,Good Times Bad Times,I sure do wish I was at home

Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I was burned in the heat of the moment
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Though it couldn't been the heat of the day
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,When I learned how my time had been wasted
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Tear fell as I turned away
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,When I should happen to fall
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Time and his bride growing older
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I've got friends who will give me fuck all
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, my baby"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Lalala
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,In the land of not quite day
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,A shiver runs down my backbone
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Face in the mirror turns grey
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,So looked 'round to hitch up the reindeer
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Searching hard trying to brighten the day
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I turned around to look for the snowman
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,To my surprise he'd melted away
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, my baby"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Lalala
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,As the moon and the stars call the order
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,The sun in my soul's sinking lower
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,While the hope in my hands turns to clay
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I don't ask that my field's full of clover
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I don't moan at opportunity's door
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"And if you ask my advice, take it slower"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Then your story'd be your finest reward
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, my baby"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, now do it"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Oh, oh, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Oh, oh, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Oh, oh, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Oh, oh, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Lost on the path to attainment
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Search in the eyes of the wise
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,When I bled from the heart of the matter
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I started bleeding without a disguise
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Now everything's fine under heaven
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Now and then you've got to take time to pause
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Or you'll land in a boat without oars
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, my baby"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Lalala, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Lalala
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I lost my way
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Hey babe, hey babe"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I really really do now
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Hey babe, hey babe"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,I don't know where I'm going to find it
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Hey babe, hey babe"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Do you want to know
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,"Let me tell you now, babe"
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Let me tell you
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,That it feels so good that it must be right
Led Zeppelin,Hots On For Nowhere,Now my babe

Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Oh, baby"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Well. There's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Like a star that can't wait for the night
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"I hate to think I've been blinded, baby"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Why can't I see you tonight?
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning

Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Another ten minutes no longer
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,And then I'm turning around
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,The clock on the wall's moving slower
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,My heart it sinks to the ground
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,And the storm that I thought would blow over
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Clouds the light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Oh, that I found"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Hey, babe!"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Ooh! Hands on the clock
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Just don't seem to stop when I'm thinking it over

Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Gotta get away, get away"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Ooh! I see it in my dreams

Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"I've got to get all, gotta get it all"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Gotta get it all, I've got to get it all"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Now my body is starting to quiver
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,And the palms of my hands getting wet
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"I've got no reason to doubt you, baby"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,It's all a terrible mess
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,And I'll run in the rain 'til I'm breathless
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop, hey"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh, yeah"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I

Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,"Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh"
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Fool In The Rain,Light of the love that I found
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,"Oh, hot dog!"
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,Well I just got into town today
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,To find my girl who's gone away
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She took the Greyhound at the General Store
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I searched myself I searched the town
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,When I finally did sit down
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I find myself no wiser than before
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She said we couldn't do no wrong
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,No other love could be so strong
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,Now she took my heart she took my keys
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,From in my old blue dungarees
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,And I'll never go to Texas anymore
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She took my love and walked right out the door
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I'm going to give her something like she never had before
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I took her love at seventeen
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,A little late these days it seems
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I took her word I took it all
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,"Beneath the sign that said ""U-Haul"""
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She left angels hanging round for more
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,She took my love and walked right out the door
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I'm going to give her something like she never had before
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I thought I had it all sewn up
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,"Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck"
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,But folks said she was after something more
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,I never did quite understand
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,All that talk about rocking bands
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,"Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door"
Led Zeppelin,Hot Dog,"Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Await their place within the ring of calm
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Await the call they know may never come
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"In times of brightness, no intruder dared upon"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"To jeopardize the course, upset the run"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,As love in the halls of plenty overrun
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Unending dances shadowed on the day
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Within the wall, their daunting formless keep"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,But no one seemed to question in anyway
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,But no one there had heaven within their reach
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,I said yeah
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Ah, ah, ah, ah"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Where was your word, where did you go?"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Where was your helping, where was your bow, bow?"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Dull is the armour, cold is the day"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"I couldn't stand it another day, another day"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,"Another day, another day"
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Touched by the timely coming
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Roused from the keeper's sleep
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Release the grip
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Throw down the key
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Held now within the knowing
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Rest now within the peace
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Take of the fruit
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,But guard the seed
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,They had to stay!
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Held now within the knowing
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Rest now within the beat
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Take of the fruit
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,But guard the seed
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,Take of the fruit
Led Zeppelin,Carouselambra,But guard the seed
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,To chase a feather in the wind
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,There moves a thread that has no end
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,For many hours and days that pass ever soon
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,The tides have caused the flame to dim
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,Is this to end or just begin?
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love to you, now"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Oh, all of my love to you, now"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,One voice is clear above the din
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"For me, the cloth once more to spin"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Oh, all of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Oh, all of my love for you now"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, all of my love, yes"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love to you, child"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,His is the force that lies within
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,He is a feather in the wind
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Oh, all of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Oh, all of my love to you, now"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, oh yes"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,All of my love to you
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,All of my love!
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Sometimes, sometimes"

Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love, all of my love"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"All of my love to you, now"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,I get a little bit lonely
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,"Just a little, just a little"
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,Just a little bit lonely
Led Zeppelin,All My Love,Just a little bit lonely
