Suede,So Young,"Because we're young, because we're gone"
Suede,So Young,"we'll take the tide's electric mind, oh yeah? oh yeah"
Suede,So Young,"we're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon, oh"
Suede,So Young,"Because we're youn, because we're gone"
Suede,So Young,"We'll scare the skies with tiger's eyes, oh yeah? oh yeah"
Suede,So Young,"we're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon, oh"
Suede,So Young,let's chase the dragon...
Suede,So Young,...from our home high in the city where the skyline
Suede,So Young,"stained the snow, I fell for a servant who kept me on the boil"
Suede,So Young,"We're so young and so gone, let's chase the dragon from our home!"
