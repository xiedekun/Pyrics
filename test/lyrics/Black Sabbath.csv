Black Sabbath,Trashed,It really was a meeting
Black Sabbath,Trashed,The bottle took a beating
Black Sabbath,Trashed,The ladies of the manor
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Watched me climb into my car and
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I was going down the track about a hundred and five
Black Sabbath,Trashed,They had the stop-watch rolling
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
Black Sabbath,Trashed,And yet my mind was blowing
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I drank a bottle of tequila and I feel real good
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I had the tape deck roaring
Black Sabbath,Trashed,But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I went of exploring
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I was turning tires burning
Black Sabbath,Trashed,The ground was in my sky
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I was laughing the bitch was trashed
Black Sabbath,Trashed,And death was in my eye
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I had the wheels in motion
Black Sabbath,Trashed,There was Peter and the Green fly laughing like drains
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Inebriation
Black Sabbath,Trashed,The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
Black Sabbath,Trashed,In my imagination
Black Sabbath,Trashed,But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Inebriation
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
Black Sabbath,Trashed,I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Ooh can you hear my lies
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes
Black Sabbath,Trashed,So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
Black Sabbath,Trashed,But there was no tequila
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Then we started on the whisky just to steady our brains
Black Sabbath,Trashed,'Cos there was no tequila
Black Sabbath,Trashed,And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
Black Sabbath,Trashed,We began to roll
Black Sabbath,Trashed,And as we get trashed we were laughing still
Black Sabbath,Trashed,Well bless my soul
