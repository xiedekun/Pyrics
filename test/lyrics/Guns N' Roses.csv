Guns N' Roses,The Garden,It's glad to know you
Guns N' Roses,The Garden,Bye-bye

Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Be it a song or a casual conversation
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,To hold my tongue speaks of quiet reservations
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Your words, once heard, they can place you in a faction"

Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Sometimes I wanna kill, sometimes I wanna die"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Sometimes I wanna destroy, sometimes I wanna cry"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Sometimes I could get even, sometimes I could give up"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Sometimes I could give, sometimes I never give a fuck"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"It's only for a while, I hope you understand"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"I never wanted this to happen, didn't want to be a man"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"So I hid inside my world, I took what I could find"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"I cried when I was lonely, I fell down when I was blind"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"So, don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause I've been where I have been and I've seen what I have seen
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,How can I ever satisfy you?
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,And how can I ever make you see that
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Deep inside, we're all somebody"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"And it don't matter who you, you wanna be?"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"But now I gotta smile, I hope you comprehend"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"For, this man can say it happened 'cause this child has been condemned"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"So I stepped into your world, I kicked you in the mind"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,And I'm the only witness to the nature of my crime
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,But look at what we've done to the innocent and young
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Whoa, listen to who's talking 'cause we're not the only ones"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,The trash collected by the eyes and dumped into the brain
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Said, it tears into our conscious thoughts, you tell me, who's to blame?"

Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,And I know you don't wanna hear me deny
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,That your satisfaction lies in your illusion
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"But your delusions are yours, and not mine"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"We take for granted, we know the whole story"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,We judge a book by its cover and read what we want
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Between selected lines
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Don't hail me and don't idolize the ink
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Or I've failed in my intentions, can you find the missing link?"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Your only validation is living your own life
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Vicarious existence is a fucking waste of time
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,So I send this song to the offended
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,I said what I meant and I've never pretended
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"As so many others do, intending just to please"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"If I damned your point of view, could you turn the other cheek?"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Oh
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Don't damn me when I speak a piece of mind
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause silence isn't golden when I'm holding it inside
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,'Cause I've been where I've been and I've seen what I have seen
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,I put the pen to the paper 'cause it's all a part of me
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Don't damn me
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"I said, don't damn me"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"I said, don't hail me"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,"Ah, don't damn me"
Guns N' Roses,Don't Damn Me,Ouh

Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Sick of this life, not that you'd care"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"I'm not the only one with whom, these feelings, I share"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,Nobody understands quite why we're here
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,We're searching for answers that never appear
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Maybe if I looked real hard, I'd, I'd see you trying, too"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,To understand this life that we're all going through
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"""Then when she said she was going to, like, wreck my car"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"I didn't know what to do"""
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Oh, sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,And I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I guess some things never change
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Oh, never change"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"I met an old cowboy, I saw the look in his eyes"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,Something tells me he's been here before 'cause experience makes you wise
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Oh, but sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Yeah, I guess some things never change"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Ooh, never change"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Still, wet behind the years"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I've been around this track a couple of times
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"But now the dust is starting to clear, oh, yeah"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,"Sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse"
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
Guns N' Roses,Dead Horse,I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more

Guns N' Roses,Coma,But this cheap investigation just can't stifle all my screams
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"And I'm waiting at the crossroads, waiting for you"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Waiting for you, where are you?"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,No one's going to bother me anymore
Guns N' Roses,Coma,No one's going to mess with my head no more
Guns N' Roses,Coma,I can't understand what all the fighting's for
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"But it's so nice here, down off the shore"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"I wish you could see this, 'cause there's nothing to see"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,It's peaceful here and it's fine with me
Guns N' Roses,Coma,Not like the world where I used to live
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"I never really wanted to live, ah"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,I know

Guns N' Roses,Coma,"You live your life like it's a coma, won't you tell me why we'd wanna?"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"With all the reasons you give, it's, it's kinda hard to believe"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,But who am I to tell you that I've seen any reason why you should stay?
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Maybe we'd be better off without you, anyway"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"You got a one-way ticket, on your last chance ride"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,Got a one-way ticket to your suicide
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Got a one-way ticket, and there's no way out alive"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,An' all this crass communication that has left you in the cold
Guns N' Roses,Coma,Isn't much for consolation when you feel so weak and old
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"But if home is where the heart is, then there's stories to be told"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"No, you don't need a doctor, no one else can heal your soul"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Got your mind in submission, got your life on the line"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"But nobody pulled the trigger, they just stepped aside"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,They be down by the water while you watch 'em waving goodbye
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"They be calling in the morning, they be hanging on the phone"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"They be waiting for an answer, but you know nobody's home"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"When the bell's stopped ringing it was nobody's fault, but your own"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"There were always ample warnings, there were always subtle signs"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,And you would have seen it comin' but we gave you too much time
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"And when you said that no one's listening, why'd your best friend drop a dime?"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Sometimes, we get so tired of waiting for a way to spend our time"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"An' it's so easy to be social, it's so easy to be cool"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"Yeah, it's easy to be hungry, when you ain't got shit to lose"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,And I wish that I could help you with what you hope to find
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"But I'm still out here, waiting, watching reruns of my life"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,"When you reach the point of breaking, know it's gonna take some time"
Guns N' Roses,Coma,To heal the broken memories that another man would need just to survive
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,What we've got here is failure to communicate
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Some men, you just can't reach"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"So, you get what we had here, last week"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Which is the way he wants it
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Well, he gets it"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,And I don't like it any more than you men
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at your young men fighting
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at your women crying
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at your young men dying
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,The way they've always done before
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the hate we're breeding
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the fear we're feeding
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the lives we're leading
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,The way we've always done before
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,My hands are tied
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,The billions shift from side to side
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,For the love of God and our human rights
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' all these things are swept aside
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"By bloody hands, time can't deny"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' are washed away by your genocide
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' history hides the lies of our civil wars
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Who said peace could last forever?
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,I went numb when I learned to see
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,So I never fell for Vietnam
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,When everybody's fightin' for their promised land
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,And I don't need your civil war
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the shoes you're filling
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the blood we're spilling
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the world we're killing
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,The way we've always done before
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the leaders we've followed
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Look at the lies we've swallowed
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' I don't want to hear no more
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,My hands are tied
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"For all, I've seen has changed my mind"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"But still, the wars go on, as the years go by"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,With no love of God or human rights
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,An' all these dreams are swept aside
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Who carry the cross of homicide
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,And history bears the scars of our civil wars
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,We practice selective annihilation
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Of mayors and government officials
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"For example, to create a vacuum"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Then we fill that vacuum
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,As popular war advances
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Peace is closer
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,I don't need your civil war
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store"
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,No no no no no no no no no no no no
Guns N' Roses,Civil War,I don't need your civil war

Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"We all come in from the cold, we come down from the wire"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,An' everybody warms themselves to a different fire
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"An' sometimes we get burned, you'd think sometime we'd learn"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,The one you love is the one that should take you higher
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"You ain't got no one, you better go back out and find her"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Just like children hidin' in a closet, can't tell what's goin' on outside"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Sometimes, we're so far off the beaten track, we get taken for a ride"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"By a parlor trick, or some words of wit, a hidden hand up a sleeve"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,To think the one you love could hurt you now is a little hard to believe
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"But everybody, darlin', sometimes bites the hand that feeds"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,When I look around an' everybody always brings me down
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Well, is it them or me? Well, I just can't see but there ain't no peace to found"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"But if someone really cared, well, they'd take the time to spare"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,A moment to try and understand another one's despair
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Remember, in this game we call life, that no one said it's fair"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Breakdown (Let me hear it now, yeah)"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"I've come to know the cold, I think of it as home"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"When there ain't enough of me to go around, I'd rather be left alone"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"But if I call you out of habit, I'm out of love and I gotta have it"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Would you give it to me if I fit your needs? Like when we both knew we had it
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Now, the damage's done and we're back out on the run"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Funny how everything was roses when we held on to the guns
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Just because you're winnin' don't mean you're the lucky one
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Breakdown (Yeah)
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Breakdown (Let me hear it now)
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"There goes the Challenger, bein' chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"The last American hero, the-the electric sintar"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"The demi-god, the super driver of the golden west"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful, lone driver"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"The police cars are getting closer, closer"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"Yeah, baby, they about to strike"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,"They gonna get him, smash, rape"
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,The last beautiful free soul on this planet
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,But it is written
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,If the evil spirit arms the tiger with claws
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Brahman provided wings for the dove
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,Thus spake the super guru
Guns N' Roses,Breakdown,D'you hear that?
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,The perils of rock n' roll decadence
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"I know this chick, she lives down on Melrose"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She ain't satisfied without some pain, ooh"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,Friday night is going up inside her again
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Well, crack the whip, 'cause that bitch is just insane"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,(I'm serious)
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Ooh, I can't tell you she's the right one"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Oh no, oh no, oh no"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Once, there was this rock and roll band, rolling on the streets"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,Time went by and it became a joke
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"We just needed more and more fulfilling, uh-huh"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,Time went by and it all went up in smoke
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,(But check it out)
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,I can't tell you she's the right one
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Oh no, oh no, oh no"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Once you made that money, it costs more, now"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,It might cost a lot more than you'd think
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,I just found a million dollars that someone forgot
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,It's days like this that push me over the brink
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,(Cool and stressing)
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,She's pretty tied up and you can ride her
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's pretty tied up, hanging upside down"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,I can't tell you she's the right one
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Oh, she's the right one, she's the right one"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,I can't tell you she's the right one
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Oh, she's the right one"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"She's the right one, she's the right one"
Guns N' Roses,Pretty Tied Up,"Oh no, whoa, whoa, whoa"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Gonna find a way to cure this loneliness
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Yeah, I'll find a way to cure the pain"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,If I said that you're my friend and our love would never end
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,How long before I had your trust again?
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I opened up the doors when it was cold outside
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Hoping that you'd find your own way in
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But how can I protect you, or try not to neglect you"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,When you won't take the love I have to give?
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Yeah, I bought me an illusion and I put it on the wall"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I let it fill my head with dreams and I had to have them all
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But, oh, the taste is never so sweet as what you'd believe it is"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Well, I guess it never is, it's these prejudiced illusions"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,That pump the blood to the heart of the biz
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"You know, I never thought that it could take so long"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,You know I never knew how to be strong
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Yeah, I let you shape me, but I feel as though you raped me"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,'Cause you climbed inside my world and in my song
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,So now I've closed the door to keep the cold outside
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Seems, somehow, I've found the will to live"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But how can I forget you, or try not to reject you"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"When we both know it takes time to forgive? Yeah, yeah"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Sweetness is a virtue and you lost your virtue long ago
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"You know I'd like to hurt you but my conscience always tells me ""No"""
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,You could sell your body on the street to anyone whom you might meet
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Who'd love to try and get inside and bust your innocence open wide
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"'Cause my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"My baby's got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I know it looks like I'm insane
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Gonna have some fun with my frustration
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Gonna watch the big screen in my head
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I'd rather take a detour 'cause this road ain't getting clearer
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Your train of thought has cut me off again
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"""Better tame that boy, 'cause he's a wild one"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Better tame that boy 'fore he's a man"""
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Sweetheart, don't make me laugh, you's getting too big for your pants"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,And I think maybe you should cut out while you can
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"You can use your illusion, let it take you where it may"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"We live and learn, and then, sometimes, it's best to walk away"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Me, I'm just here hanging on, it's my only place to stay"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"At least for now, anyway"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I've worked too hard for my illusions just to throw them all away
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I'm taking time for quiet consolation
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,In passing by this love that's passed away
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"I know it's never easy, so why should you believe me"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,When I've always got so many things to say?
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Callin' off the dogs, a simple choice is made"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,'Cause playful hearts can sometimes be enraged
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"You know I tried to wake you, I mean how long could it take you"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,To open up your eyes and turn the page?
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Kindness is a treasure and it's one, towards me, you've seldom shown"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"So, I'll say it, for good measure, to all the ones like you, I've known"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Ya know I'd like to shave your head and all my friends could paint it red
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"'Cause love to me is a two-way street, an' all I really want is peace"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I know it looks like I'm insane
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Affection is a blessing, can you find it in your sordid heart?"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I tried to keep this thing together but the tremor tore my pad apart
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Yeah, I know, it's hard to face when all we've worked for's gone to waste"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,But you're such a stupid woman and I'm such a stupid man
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But love, like time, 's got its own plans"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"But my baby's got a locomotive, my baby's gone off the track"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"My baby got a locomotive, got to peel the bitch off my back"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,I know it looks like I'm insane
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Take a closer look, I'm not to blame, no"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,"Yeah, if love is blind, I guess I'll buy myself a cane"
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,Locomotive,Love's so strange
Guns N' Roses,So Fine,How could she look so fine?
Guns N' Roses,So Fine,"How could it be, she might be mine?"
Guns N' Roses,So Fine,How could she be so cool?
Guns N' Roses,So Fine,"I've been taken for a fool, so many times, hey"

Guns N' Roses,Estranged,I'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone

Guns N' Roses,Estranged,But everythin' we've ever known's here
Guns N' Roses,Estranged,I never wanted it to die

Guns N' Roses,You Could Be Mine,"'Cause this couch-trip's gettin' older, tell me how long has it been?"

Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,If there's nothin' I can gain from this or anythin' at all
Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,It'd be the knowledge that you gave me when I thought I'd heard it all

Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,If I could go back in time to the place in my soul
Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,"There, all alone, lonely teardrops, ooh, are calling you"
Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,"But I don't want to know it, now, 'cause knowing you"
Guns N' Roses,There Was A Time,"It won't change a damn thing, but there was a time"

Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,"If there were doubts, you should be careful and unafraid"
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,Now they surround you
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,And all that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,"So, if my affections are misunderstood"
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,And you decide I'm up to no good
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,Don't ask me to enjoy them just for you
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,Ask yourself why I would choose to prostitute myself
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,To live with fortune and shame? Oh yeah
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,When you should have turned to the hearts
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,Of the ones that you would not save
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,I told you when I found you
Guns N' Roses,Prostitute,All that amounts to is love that you fed by perversion and pain
