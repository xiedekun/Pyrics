Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,If they would open their eyes it'd be so plain to see
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,That the best things in life don't come so easily
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,I met a man who thought just a little bit different from me
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,He said you got it so easy but I just had to disagree
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,It would have been alright but he pushed me too far
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,If your lookin' for trouble step outside of this bar
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,"IF it comes down to fistin', mister that ain't nothin' new to me"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,You'll find in this life if there's somethin' that you believe
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,You got to get your hands dirty when it's somethin' that you really need
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,If they ever give you somethin' too easily
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,"Can't be too good, 'cause nothin' good's for free"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Best Things In Life,Tell ya' straight from the heart a bed of roses it will never be
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,There's a grey horse standin' still
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,As a soldier climbs in the saddle for one last ride
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,The rain pours off his hat
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,You can see the shadows of the past written in his eyes
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Now the cannons are silent
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,"His friends are all gone, gotta put it all behind him"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,If he ever wants to find his way home
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,He's the last rebel on the road
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Just a boy with his old guitar
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Keeps to himself but everybody takes him wrong
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,"But he carried on, got a dream that will never die"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Can't change him
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,No use in staying where you don't belong
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Now he's rollin' down the highway
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,Gone too far too fast
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,No one will ever find him
Lynyrd Skynyrd,The Last Rebel,He'll never look back

Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,There's a story to tell about days of old
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"A man and his gun, a street fighter I'm told"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"There's one in every town, tryin' to make himself a name"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"If he's quicker on the draw, comes glory and fame"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,Move around from town to town can't stay in any place to long
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"Outlaws, renegades... rebels on the run"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,Things haven't changed much these days
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"Faces are younger, but still they keep playing the deadliest game"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,O.R.R.,"Brothers and sisters, what are we fightin' for"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,To a brand new day on the end of time
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,We're gonna rise as one or fall together
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,Out here on the ledge
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,We're standing on the edge...of forever
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,From the silence I hear the thunder roll
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,Words of the prophets echo in my soul
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,One salvation in the world to me

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,We can face what's meant to be
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,Now there's power in the wrong hands
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,A madman in a foreign land
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,If we don't get our senses
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,It's all gonna slip away
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Edge Of Forever,Take my hand we're gonna cross the line

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',Smart enough to have a large mouth
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"If you can hook 'em, you can mount 'em"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',You can keep 'em around
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"But if they break your line, they're gonna go back down"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Since I was a kid, I felt this way"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"I fell hook, line and sinker gone fishin'"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"I've been everywhere, tried everything"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',But there ain't nothin' that feels the same
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"When you find the right one, it's a magical thing"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Next thing you know, it's a diamond ring"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Well, she hooked me and took my name"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"I fell hook line and sinker gone fishin', yeah"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Gone, gone fishin', she hooked me"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Gone, gone fishin', yeah, yeah"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gone Fishin',"Gone, gone, gone fishin', yeah"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Well I heard it on the late night radio
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,For the umpteenth time headin' from LA to the Florida coast
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,I was between black coffee and shifting gears
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,When the second verse took a turn and brought me to tears
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,"They were talkin' about love, I do and forever"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,And how two people ought to stay together
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Well the music hit me but the singer's got it all wrong
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unwrite that song
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unwrite that song
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,'Cause what he's saying to me don't go with that melody
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unsing them lines about those happy times
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Don't they know she's gone
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unwrite that song
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Well it was 3 AM and she was cryin' and her eyes were all red
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,When that music video came on and she sat up in her bed
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,She grabbed that whiskey bottle
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Poured one last shot
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,And threw that empty glass at the TV and screamed
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unwrite that song
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,Unwrite that song
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Unwrite That Song,'Cause what he's saying to me don't go with that melody

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Floyd was a trapper way back in the holler
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Made moonshine so he could make a dollar
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Six feet tall, dressed in overalls"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,And wore himself a long gray beard
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,People say Floyd came to town one day
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,But two law dogs got in his way
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Floyd never hurt no one in his life
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,But they never came back this way
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"No, they never came back this way"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,And the people say...
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,And the creeper was a creepin' and the souls they were hollerin' singin'
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,The G-men came out to track him down
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"But the swamp was too deep, even one of them drowned"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,They sent in the hellhounds but they turned around singing
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,How how how how how
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,And the people say...
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Yeah the creeper he was creepin'
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Sherriff Boudreaux came to talk to his neighbors
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,All they could say is he was eaten by a gator
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,The legend lives on but Floyd he's at home singing
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,How how how how how
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,And the soul said...
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye hear the hound dogs moan"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,"Aye, aye, aye, aye now that Floyd is long gone"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,There's a full moon now
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,The moon was shinin' bright singing
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Floyd,Aye aye aye aye aye

Lynyrd Skynyrd,That Ain't My America,"And they ain't afraid of nothing, when when they're holding either one"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,That Ain't My America,Now there's kids who can't pray in school
Lynyrd Skynyrd,That Ain't My America,$100 dollar tanks of gas

Lynyrd Skynyrd,God & Guns,"Liked his plans, but they came undone"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,God & Guns,When he got around to God and guns

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,I remember the day that he came in
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,I can't believe how long it's been
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,"Like a poet, he began to play"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Just an old friend that hung with the band
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,A drinkin' man he had no plan
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,But he played the 'Bird...
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Played it for free
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,'Cause I know he's here
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,He's everywhere
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Take a look around oh and you will see
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,That cross we bear
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,It's in the air
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Lord we thank you for these gifted hands
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,There are demons we live with every day
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,That tear at our hearts and take us away
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,To another place
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Some of us don't get back
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,This song is for the hands of the workin' man
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Who believes in himself and he understands
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,"Love, hope, and faith are The Maker's plan"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,'Cause I know he's here
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,He's everywhere

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,Lord we thank you for these gifted hands
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,One day we'll all take that ride
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Gifted Hands,And with those gifted hands I know you'll fly
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,Somewhere south of Winslow the road went right and I went left
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Nothin' out my window but desert, dirt, and death"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,From outta nowhere stood an angel from up in the air
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,Sometimes that hot horizon plays tricks on you I swear
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Oh, I picked her up"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Sure enough that girl was real, sittin' in my truck"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,Said I know a place called the Broken Wheel where we can try our luck
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Five miles north of 66, behind old man Lester's barn"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,Where the whisky flows and the money goes and the sherriff claims that he don't know
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Oh, here I go again, singin'"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,BANG BANG
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,That cell door's closin' in

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,4 AM I was outta cash when she whispered in my ear
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"I got a gun and a plan, pull the truck up to the rear"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,Yeah it hit me like a tire tool right between the eyes
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,When the door flew open - she came out screamin'
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,DRIVE FOOL DRIVE!!!
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Bang Bang,"Oh, here I go again singin'"

Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Mud-covered cornfields starin' out my back door
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The barn's leaning over now and that deer don't run no more
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,"So much life before, now that dream is gone"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,When the factory burned down I moved up to the city
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The school we all went to is a memory that got bulldozed
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,And the good times froze when that door closed
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The only thing that comes through here
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Is stormy weather
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,And it's raining
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,It's raining in my heartland
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,We're packing them boxes for something better
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Ran across my mom and dad's old love letters
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,And the photograph of this house that we're standin' in now
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Let's stop by the church where we got married
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Walk out back where your grandma's buried
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,And say goodbye one last time
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The only thing that comes through here
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Is stormy weather
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,And it's raining
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,It's raining in my heartland
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Some dreams just stop growing where you plant them
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,You gotta count your blessings and be happy that you've had them
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,"Let's grab a shovel baby, dig us a new life"
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Main Street's still there but the stores are all empty
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The car lot where my daddy worked is dirt and stone
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,The only thing that comes through here
Lynyrd Skynyrd,Raining In My Heartland,Is stormy weather
