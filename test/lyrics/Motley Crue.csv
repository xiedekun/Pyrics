Motley Crue,In The Beginning,In the beginning
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,Good always overpowered the evils
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,Of all man's sins...
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,But in time
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,The nations grew weak
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,And our cities fell to slums
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,While evil stood strong
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,In the dusts of hell
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,Lurked the blackest of hates
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,For he whom they feared
Motley Crue,In The Beginning,Awaited them... Now many many lifetimes later

Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,He'll be the blood between your thighs
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,And then have you Cry for more
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,He'll put strength to the test
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,He'll put the thrill back in bed
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,Sure you've heard it all before
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,He'll be the risk in the kiss
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,Might be anger on your lips
Motley Crue,Shout At The Devil,Might run scared for the door
