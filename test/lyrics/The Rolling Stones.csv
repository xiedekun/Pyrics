The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Well she drew out all her money out from southern trust
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,And put a little boy aboard a Greyhound bus
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Leaving Louisiana for the golden west
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Down came her tears from her happiness
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Her own little son named Johnny B Goode
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Now bye bye bye bye
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Now bye bye bye bye
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Well, she remember taking money out from gathering crops"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,As long as he could play it by the railroad side
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,And wouldn't get in trouble she'd be satisfied
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Never thought there'd ever come a day like this
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,When she would gladly give her son a goodbye kiss
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Bye bye, bye bye bye"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Bye bye, bye bye bye"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Well she finally got the letter she was dreaming of
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,As soon as he was married he would bring her back
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,And build a mansion for her by the railroad tracks
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,And every time they heard the locomotive roar
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"They'd be a standing, waving in the kitchen door"
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Now bye bye bye bye
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,Now bye bye bye bye
The Rolling Stones,Bye Bye Johnny,"Bye bye Johnny, bye bye Johnny B Goode"
